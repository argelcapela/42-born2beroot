ARCH=$(uname -srvmo)

# /* 
#     'uname': print system information.
#          -s: print the kernel name.
#          -r: kernel release. (published, because among a lot of versions just few final versions are ðŸ‘ŒðŸ˜Ž "leased")
#          -v: kernel version.
#          -m: hardware (32bits or 64bits for example).
#          -o: SO.

# 2) The number of physical processors:
PCPU=$(cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep 'physical id' | uniq | wc -l)

# /* 
#     What is 'physical processor'? is the number of devices on your motherboard. More advanced computers have more than one physical CPU.
#
#     'cat /proc/cpuinfo': show us a lot of information about the physical CPU.
#      grep 'physical id': the output will have more than 1 information group, because one CPU may have more than 1 cores, so we need to filter and show just, lines with the word 'physical id' present.
#                   uniq : remove similar lines, this will show exactly just the PHYSICAL amount of CPU(s).
#                  wc -l : return the amount of lines of stdout
#                      -l: count lines of stdout.
